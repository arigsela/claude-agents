# Skills Integration - Phase 1 Complete ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Successfully Implemented
**Implementation Time**: ~1 hour

## Summary

Successfully integrated Claude Skills into the oncall troubleshooting agent using **manual integration** (Phase 1 approach). The agent now has access to structured Kubernetes troubleshooting knowledge and homelab runbook procedures.

## Changes Made

### 1. Skills Directory Structure

Created `.claude/skills/` directory with two skills:

```
oncall/
├── .claude/
│   └── skills/
│       ├── k8s-failure-patterns.md    # Copy from k8s-monitor
│       └── homelab-runbooks.md        # New custom skill
```

### 2. Skills Content

#### **k8s-failure-patterns.md** (~1,200 tokens)
- CrashLoopBackOff patterns and investigation steps
- ImagePullBackOff troubleshooting
- OOMKilled diagnosis
- Pending pod analysis
- Service-specific known issues

#### **homelab-runbooks.md** (~10,000 tokens) - NEW
- Vault unsealing procedure
- ECR authentication troubleshooting
- MySQL troubleshooting guide
- chores-tracker slow startup explanation
- ArgoCD deployment correlation
- Service dependency chain
- Priority classification guide
- General troubleshooting checklist

### 3. Code Modifications

**File**: `oncall/src/api/agent_client.py`

**Added**:
- `pathlib.Path` import
- `_load_skill_content()` method - Loads skills from `.claude/skills/` directory
- Modified `_get_system_prompt()` to:
  - Load both skills
  - Append skill content to system prompt
  - Add explicit "YOU MUST" instructions for skill usage

**Lines Changed**: +50 lines added

### 4. Test Results

**Test Script**: `oncall/test_skills.py`

**Results**:
```
✅ Client initialized successfully
✅ k8s-failure-patterns skill found in prompt
✅ homelab-runbooks skill found in prompt
✅ Found: CrashLoopBackOff content
✅ Found: ImagePullBackOff content
✅ Found: Vault Unsealing content
✅ Found: ECR Authentication content
✅ Found: IMPORTANT: Using Skills Knowledge instructions
✅ System prompt size: 15,857 characters (~4K tokens)
```

## Skills Integration Details

### How It Works

1. **Agent Initialization**: When `OnCallAgentClient()` is instantiated:
   - `_get_system_prompt()` is called
   - Skills are loaded via `_load_skill_content()`
   - Skill content is appended to base system prompt
   - Explicit usage instructions added

2. **Skill Format**: Skills use YAML frontmatter:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: skill-name
   description: What it does
   version: 1.0.0
   ---

   # Skill content...
   ```

3. **Loading Logic**:
   - Reads `.claude/skills/{skill-name}.md`
   - Extracts content after YAML frontmatter (second `---`)
   - Formats as: `# SKILL: {name}\n\n{content}`
   - Logs success: `✅ Loaded skill: {name} ({chars} chars)`

### Explicit Instructions Added

The agent receives these instructions:

```markdown
## IMPORTANT: Using Skills Knowledge

When troubleshooting Kubernetes issues, YOU MUST:
1. **Identify the failure type** from k8s-failure-patterns
2. **Reference "Common Causes"** for the specific failure
3. **Include "Investigation Steps"** with kubectl commands
4. **Apply runbook procedures** for known scenarios
5. **Cite which skill you're using** in responses
```

## Expected API Response Improvements

### Before Skills
```
chores-tracker pod is failing.
Possible causes: application error, config issue, resource limits.
Check logs with: kubectl logs -n chores-tracker-backend <pod>
```

### After Skills
```
According to the k8s-failure-patterns skill, this is a CrashLoopBackOff issue.

**Common Causes** (from skill):
1. Application crash on startup
2. Missing environment variables
3. Failed health checks
4. Database connection failures

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Check pod logs: `kubectl logs -n chores-tracker-backend <pod> --tail=100`
2. Check pod events: `kubectl describe pod -n chores-tracker-backend <pod>`
3. Verify resource usage: `kubectl top pod -n chores-tracker-backend`

**Known Issue Check** (from homelab-runbooks):
chores-tracker-backend has a **5-6 minute startup time which is NORMAL**.
Only investigate if startup exceeds 10 minutes.
```

## Token Impact

- **Base system prompt**: ~2,000 characters (~500 tokens)
- **k8s-failure-patterns**: ~5,000 characters (~1,250 tokens)
- **homelab-runbooks**: ~10,000 characters (~2,500 tokens)
- **Total system prompt**: ~16,000 characters (~4,000 tokens)

**Cost per query** (Haiku 4.5):
- Input tokens: ~4K tokens = ~$0.001 per query
- Still very cost-effective!

## Testing the Integration

### Manual Test
```bash
cd oncall
python test_skills.py
```

### API Test (when server running)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key" \
  -d '{"prompt": "chores-tracker pod has been starting for 5 minutes, is this normal?"}'
```

**Expected Response**: Should reference homelab-runbooks and explain 5-6 min startup is normal.

## Next Steps (Phase 2 - Future)

Phase 2 would add **document generation capabilities** using code execution:

### Use Cases
1. **PDF Incident Reports**: Generate formatted post-incident reports
2. **Excel Dashboards**: Create metric dashboards with charts
3. **Automated Documentation**: Export runbooks as PDFs

### Requirements
- Add code execution support to agent_client.py
- Implement Files API integration
- Create new endpoints: `/report/pdf`, `/report/excel`
- Update Docker image for code execution environment

### Estimated Effort
- 1-2 weeks implementation
- More architectural complexity
- Higher value for stakeholder reporting

## Decision Point

**Recommendation**: **Pause at Phase 1** and evaluate:
1. Are API responses improved with skills?
2. Do users cite the runbooks and patterns?
3. Is there demand for PDF/Excel generation?

If Phase 1 provides sufficient value, **no need to proceed to Phase 2**. The current implementation is:
- ✅ Low complexity
- ✅ Easy to maintain (edit .md files)
- ✅ Cost-effective (~4K tokens)
- ✅ No architectural changes required
- ✅ Proven pattern (same as k8s-monitor)

## Files Modified

- `oncall/src/api/agent_client.py` (+50 lines)
- Created: `oncall/.claude/skills/k8s-failure-patterns.md` (copied)
- Created: `oncall/.claude/skills/homelab-runbooks.md` (new)
- Created: `oncall/test_skills.py` (test script)
- Created: `oncall/docs/skills-integration-phase1.md` (this file)

## Rollback Instructions

If skills cause issues, revert the changes:

```bash
cd oncall
git checkout src/api/agent_client.py  # Revert code changes
rm -rf .claude/skills/                 # Remove skills directory
```

Or disable skills loading without removing files:

```python
# In agent_client.py, comment out skills loading:
# skills_to_load = ["k8s-failure-patterns", "homelab-runbooks"]
skills_to_load = []  # Disable skills
```

## Success Metrics

To evaluate Phase 1 effectiveness:

1. **Response Quality**:
   - ✅ Detailed kubectl commands included?
   - ✅ References to Common Causes and Investigation Steps?
   - ✅ Correct identification of known issues (vault, slow startup)?

2. **User Satisfaction**:
   - Do troubleshooting responses feel more helpful?
   - Are runbook procedures being followed?
   - Reduced back-and-forth for clarification?

3. **Cost Impact**:
   - ~4K tokens per query is acceptable (~$0.001/query with Haiku)
   - Monitor token usage in logs

## Conclusion

**Phase 1 Skills Integration: Complete ✅**

The oncall agent now has structured Kubernetes troubleshooting knowledge and homelab runbooks integrated directly into its system prompt. This provides:

- **Better responses** with detailed investigation steps
- **Consistent guidance** across all queries
- **No architectural changes** required
- **Easy maintenance** (edit .md files)
- **Proven approach** (same as k8s-monitor)

**Next Action**: Deploy to production and evaluate effectiveness before considering Phase 2 (document generation).
