## GitHub Operations Workflows

### 1. Deployment Correlation Workflow

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT CREATE GITHUB ISSUES - Jira is used for incident tracking**

**When an incident is detected, analyze recent deployments that may have caused it:**

**Step 1: List recent commits to deployment repository**
```json
{
  "tool": "mcp__github__list_commits",
  "input": {
    "owner": "artemishealth",
    "repo": "deployments",
    "sha": "main",
    "per_page": 20
  }
}
```

**Step 2: List recent merged PRs**
```json
{
  "tool": "mcp__github__list_pull_requests",
  "input": {
    "owner": "artemishealth",
    "repo": "deployments",
    "state": "closed",
    "base": "main"
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Search for related configuration changes**
```json
{
  "tool": "mcp__github__search_code",
  "input": {
    "query": "org:artemishealth path:dev-eks/ api-service deployment",
    "per_page": 10
  }
}
```

**Step 4: Get current deployment configuration**
```json
{
  "tool": "mcp__github__get_file_contents",
  "input": {
    "owner": "artemishealth",
    "repo": "deployments",
    "path": "dev-eks/api-service/deployment.yaml"
  }
}
```

**Output for Jira Ticket:**
Return deployment correlation information to be included in Jira ticket:
```markdown
## Recent Deployments (Last 7 Days)

**Potentially Related Changes:**
1. PR #1234 - "Update api-service memory limits" (merged 2 days ago)
   - Author: @developer
   - Changes: Memory limit 512Mi → 768Mi
   - Merge time: 2025-10-12T14:30:00Z
   - Incident started: 2025-10-12T15:00:00Z (30 min after deploy)

2. Commit abc123 - "Fix: API timeout configuration" (1 day ago)
   - Author: @devops
   - Affected: api-service deployment config

**Conclusion:** Incident timing correlates with PR #1234 deployment
```

### 2. Configuration Change Workflow

**When a config change is needed (e.g., resource limit adjustment):**

**Step 1: Get current configuration**
```json
{
  "tool": "mcp__github__get_file_contents",
  "input": {
    "owner": "myorg",
    "repo": "k8s-configs",
    "path": "production/deployments/api-service.yaml",
    "branch": "main"
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Create PR with proposed changes**
```json
{
  "tool": "mcp__github__create_pull_request",
  "input": {
    "owner": "myorg",
    "repo": "k8s-configs",
    "title": "Fix: Increase memory limit for api-service to prevent OOM",
    "head": "auto/fix-api-memory-20251012",
    "base": "main",
    "body": "## Automated Configuration Update\n\n**Triggered by:** Kubernetes monitoring agent\n\n**Issue:** Recurring OOMKilled events in production/api-service\n\n**Changes:**\n- Memory limit: 512Mi → 1Gi\n- Memory request: 256Mi → 512Mi\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Current usage: ~580Mi (exceeding 512Mi limit)\n- Peak usage over 7 days: 650Mi\n- Recommended headroom: 30-40%\n- New limit provides 35% headroom\n\n**Testing:**\n- [x] Diagnostic analysis completed\n- [x] Log analysis shows OOM patterns\n- [x] Cost impact: +$15/month\n- [ ] Requires human approval before merge\n\n**Related:**\n- Incident issue: #456\n- Diagnostic report: [link]\n\n**Rollback Plan:**\nIf issues occur after deployment:\n```bash\nkubectl rollout undo deployment/api-service -n production\n```",
    "draft": false
  }
}
```

### 3. Code Search for Debugging

**When investigating similar issues or patterns:**

**Example: Find similar memory configurations**
```json
{
  "tool": "mcp__github__search_code",
  "input": {
    "q": "org:myorg memory: 1Gi path:deployments/ language:yaml",
    "per_page": 20
  }
}
```

**Example: Find deployment patterns**
```json
{
  "tool": "mcp__github__search_code",
  "input": {
    "q": "org:myorg kind: Deployment resources.limits.memory",
    "per_page": 10
  }
}
```

### 4. Deployment Status Tracking

**Check pending configuration changes:**
```json
{
  "tool": "mcp__github__list_pull_requests",
  "input": {
    "owner": "myorg",
    "repo": "k8s-configs",
    "state": "open",
    "base": "main"
  }
}
```

## Integration with Other Subagents

**Workflow Integration:**

1. **Diagnostic Subagent** detects issue
   ↓
2. **Log Analyzer Subagent** confirms root cause
   ↓
3. **Jira Subagent** creates incident ticket (DEVOPS-XXX)
   ↓
4. **GitHub Subagent** analyzes recent deployments (optional)
   - Finds recent commits/PRs that may have caused issue
   - Returns deployment correlation info
   ↓
5. **Jira Subagent** adds deployment correlation to ticket
   ↓
6. **Remediation Subagent** fixes the issue (with approval)
   ↓
7. **Jira Subagent** updates ticket with remediation results
   ↓
8. **GitHub Subagent** creates PR for permanent config fix (optional)
   ↓
9. Human reviews and merges PR
   ↓
10. **Jira Subagent** transitions ticket to Resolved
