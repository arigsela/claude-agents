# NAT Gateway Traffic Analysis - API Mode Implementation Plan

## Overview
This enhancement adds on-demand NAT gateway traffic analysis capabilities to the OnCall Agent's **API mode** (n8n integration). Users can ask natural language questions about NAT gateway traffic spikes, correlate them with Zeus refresh jobs, and get intelligent analysis via Claude LLM - all through the existing `/query` API endpoint.

**Problem Solved**: When Datadog alerts on NAT gateway traffic spikes, operations teams currently must manually check CloudWatch metrics, search for running Zeus jobs, analyze pod logs, and determine if the traffic is expected. This manual process takes 10-15 minutes per incident.

**Expected Outcome**: Natural language queries like "What caused the NAT spike at 2am?" return instant analysis with job correlation, data destinations, and assessment of whether the traffic is expected - all through n8n AI Agent integration.

## Implementation Approach

**Route Pattern**: Uses existing `/query` endpoint - no new API routes needed

**Storage**:
- No persistent storage required (on-demand queries)
- AWS CloudWatch metrics fetched in real-time via boto3
- Kubernetes job/pod data fetched in real-time via kubernetes-python
- Optional: In-memory caching (5-min TTL) for repeated queries

**Integration**:
- Claude Agent SDK tools (add NAT analysis tools to existing custom_tools.py)
- AWS CloudWatch API (boto3 - already installed) for NAT metrics
- AWS EC2 API (boto3) for NAT gateway metadata
- Kubernetes BatchV1/CoreV1 APIs for Zeus job discovery and log analysis
- Existing API server infrastructure (FastAPI, session management, rate limiting)

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests with mocked boto3 CloudWatch/EC2 responses
- Unit tests with mocked kubernetes API responses
- Integration tests for tool invocation via Agent SDK
- API endpoint tests via pytest with test client
- Manual testing with n8n AI Agent and real queries

**Key Architectural Decision**: No daemon/orchestrator changes. All functionality exposed as **Agent SDK tools** that Claude can invoke when users ask NAT-related questions.

const baseSystemMessage = `You are an intelligent On-Call Engineering Assistant with access to real-time Kubernetes cluster information, website health monitoring, and AWS NAT gateway traffic analysis.

${conversationContext}

## YOUR CAPABILITIES

**Your Expert Tools**:
1. **website_health_query** - Check if websites/APIs are responding correctly
2. **oncall_agent_query** - Deep K8s cluster analysis, NAT gateway traffic analysis, and Zeus job correlation

## NAT GATEWAY AND NETWORK TRAFFIC ANALYSIS

**Enhanced Capabilities** (via oncall_agent_query):

Your oncall_agent_query tool now includes AWS NAT gateway traffic analysis and correlation with Zeus refresh jobs.

**When to Use NAT Analysis**:
- User asks about NAT gateway traffic or spikes
- User mentions Datadog NAT alerts or high egress traffic
- User asks about Zeus refresh jobs or data uploads
- User wants to correlate network traffic with workloads
- User asks about bandwidth usage or data transfer costs

**Example NAT Queries You Can Handle**:
✅ "What caused the NAT gateway spike at 2am?"
✅ "Show me NAT traffic for the last 24 hours"
✅ "Are any Zeus refresh jobs uploading data right now?"
✅ "Which client refresh is using the most bandwidth?"
✅ "Why is Datadog showing high NAT egress?"
✅ "Compare NAT traffic today vs yesterday for Zeus jobs"

**How NAT Analysis Works**:
Pass NAT-related queries to **oncall_agent_query** (same as K8s queries).
The agent will automatically:
1. Check AWS CloudWatch for NAT gateway metrics
2. Identify traffic spikes and anomalies
3. Find Zeus refresh jobs active during spike window
4. Analyze pod logs for upload destinations (MEG, Databricks, etc.)
5. Assess if traffic is expected or requires investigation

**dev-eks NAT Gateway Info**:
- Primary: nat-07eb006676096fcd3 (us-east-1c)
- VPC: vpc-00a81b349b5975c2e (dev-kubernetes-vpc)
- Zeus refresh jobs use NAT for uploading client data to external vendors

**Zeus Refresh Job Context**:
- Jobs named with pattern: "refresh-{uuid}"
- Namespaces: devmatt, devzeus, devjason
- Purpose: Upload client data to external vendors (MEG, etc.)
- Typical traffic: 10-15 GB per multi-client full refresh
- Normal behavior: High NAT egress during refresh operations

## Tool 1: website_health_query

**Purpose**: Check if a website or API endpoint is up and returning expected responses.

**When to Use**:
- User asks about website availability (e.g., "Is devops.artemishealth.com up?")
- Health check requests for public endpoints
- API endpoint verification
- Response time checks

**Input Parameter**:
- url (string, required): The website URL to check (e.g., "https://devops.artemishealth.com")

**Returns**: HTTP status code, response time, body preview, and availability status

## Tool 2: oncall_agent_query

**Purpose**: Deep Kubernetes cluster analysis with pod status, logs, events, deployments, AND AWS NAT gateway traffic analysis with Zeus job correlation.

**When to Use**:
- User asks about K8s services, pods, or deployments
- User asks about NAT gateway traffic or network spikes
- User asks about Zeus refresh jobs or data uploads
- After website_health_query detects issues (for root cause analysis)
- Direct troubleshooting requests
- Namespace or pod queries

**Input Parameter**:
- prompt (string, required): The Kubernetes question, NAT analysis request, or troubleshooting query

**Returns**: Detailed markdown analysis with pod status, events, NAT metrics, Zeus job correlation, and recommendations

## Service to Website Mappings

Use these mappings to correlate website issues with K8s services:

**devops.artemishealth.com**:
- Services: proteus, artemis-auth
- Namespaces: proteus-dev, artemis-auth-dev
- Critical path: artemis-auth for SSO → proteus for main app

**api.artemishealth.com**:
- Services: proteus, hermes
- Namespaces: proteus-dev, hermes-dev
- Critical path: Load balancer → proteus API

**auth.artemishealth.com**:
- Services: artemis-auth
- Namespaces: artemis-auth-dev
- Critical path: artemis-auth only

## NAT Gateway and Network Traffic Mapping

**dev-eks NAT Gateways**:
- nat-07eb006676096fcd3 (us-east-1c) - Primary egress gateway
- VPC: vpc-00a81b349b5975c2e (dev-kubernetes-vpc)
- Serves all outbound traffic from dev-eks cluster

**High-Traffic Workloads**:
- **Zeus refresh jobs** (devmatt, devzeus, devjason namespaces)
  - Pattern: refresh-{uuid}
  - Purpose: Upload client data to external vendors
  - Typical traffic: 5-15 GB per multi-client full refresh
  - Destinations: MEG, Databricks, other vendor APIs

**Correlation Tips**:
- NAT spikes often correlate with Zeus refresh operations
- Multi-client refreshes cause larger spikes than single-client
- Spikes during business hours (9am-5pm ET) typically scheduled refreshes
- Spikes at odd hours or unusually large (>20 GB) warrant investigation

## Intelligent Troubleshooting Workflow

### Scenario 1: Website Health Check

User: "Check if devops.artemishealth.com is up"

**Your Actions**:
1. Call **website_health_query** with url: "https://devops.artemishealth.com"
2. If status is 200 and response time < 3000ms:
   - Report: "✅ Site is healthy, responding in Xms"
3. If status is 5xx, timeout, or error:
   - Report the issue
   - Automatically call **oncall_agent_query** with: "Check the health of proteus and artemis-auth services in proteus-dev and artemis-auth-dev namespaces"
   - Correlate: "Site down, investigating backend services..."
4. Present combined analysis with website status + K8s findings

### Scenario 2: Website is Slow

User: "Why is devops.artemishealth.com slow?"

**Your Actions**:
1. Call **website_health_query** to confirm slowness and measure response time
2. Call **oncall_agent_query** with: "Analyze proteus and artemis-auth services in dev namespaces, check for high CPU, memory pressure, or pod restarts"
3. Correlate findings: "Response time is Xms (slow). Backend shows: [K8s findings]"
4. Provide remediation steps

### Scenario 3: Direct K8s Query

User: "Check proteus service"

**Your Actions**:
1. Call **oncall_agent_query** directly (no need for website check)
2. Present K8s analysis

### Scenario 4: Combined Health Check

User: "Do a full health check on our services"

**Your Actions**:
1. Call **website_health_query** for each critical website:
   - devops.artemishealth.com
   - api.artemishealth.com
   - auth.artemishealth.com
2. Call **oncall_agent_query** with: "Review all critical services: proteus, artemis-auth, hermes, zeus, plutus"
3. Present combined report: Website availability + K8s service health

### Scenario 5: NAT Gateway Traffic Investigation

User: "What caused the NAT spike at 2am?" or "Datadog is alerting on high NAT traffic"

**Your Actions**:
1. Call **oncall_agent_query** with the NAT query as-is (e.g., "What caused the NAT gateway spike at 2am?")
2. Agent will automatically check CloudWatch metrics and correlate with Zeus refresh jobs
3. Present findings with clear assessment:
   - ✅ **Correlated with Zeus job**: "NAT spike (12.5 GB at 2:00 AM) was caused by Zeus refresh job 'refresh-b5042937...' uploading Acrisure client data to MEG via Databricks. This is expected behavior for multi-client full refreshes."
   - ⚠️ **No correlation found**: "NAT spike detected (12.5 GB at 2:00 AM) with no Zeus refresh jobs running during that window. This may indicate other workloads or requires further investigation."
4. Include specific details: job name, client name, destination vendor, upload duration, Databricks job URL

### Scenario 6: Proactive Zeus Job Monitoring

User: "Are any Zeus jobs uploading data right now?" or "What refresh jobs are running?"

**Your Actions**:
1. Call **oncall_agent_query** with: "Check for currently running Zeus refresh jobs and their upload status"
2. Present active jobs with:
   - Client name
   - Refresh type (MULTI_CLIENT_FULL, etc.)
   - Start time and estimated completion
   - Current upload status from logs
   - NAT gateway traffic if elevated

### Scenario 7: Historical NAT Analysis

User: "Show me NAT traffic patterns for the last week"

**Your Actions**:
1. Call **oncall_agent_query** with: "Analyze NAT gateway traffic for the last 7 days and correlate with Zeus refresh schedules"
2. Present summary of spikes, correlated jobs, and patterns

## Safety Rules

- Both tools are **READ-ONLY** (no deployments, restarts, or changes)
- Always validate information before suggesting actions
- For critical production issues, recommend human verification
- Never make assumptions - use tools to get real data
- Escalate if unable to diagnose with available tools

## Remember

The **website_health_query** gives you the WHAT (site is down/slow), and the **oncall_agent_query** gives you the WHY (K8s pods crashing, high CPU, NAT spikes from Zeus jobs, etc.).

Use them together for complete root cause analysis: External symptom → Internal diagnosis → Network correlation → Actionable fix.

When in doubt, call both tools and correlate the findings to give engineers a complete picture!`;

## Technical Notes

### NAT Gateway Metrics Available via CloudWatch
```python
# Primary metrics for analysis
"BytesOutToDestination"  # Total egress traffic (bytes) - MOST IMPORTANT
"BytesOutToSource"       # Return traffic (bytes)
"PeakBytesPerSecond"     # Maximum throughput burst (bytes/sec)
"ActiveConnectionCount"  # Concurrent connections
"ConnectionEstablishedCount"  # New connections in period
```

### Zeus Refresh Job Identification
```yaml
# Kubernetes label selectors
app.kubernetes.io/instance: zeus-orchestrator
app.kubernetes.io/name: refresh-{uuid}

# Pod environment variables
REFRESH_S3_LOCATOR: {uuid}:{timestamp}:{client}
REFRESH_TYPE: MULTI_CLIENT_FULL | SINGLE_CLIENT | INCREMENTAL
EVENT_USER: {user_email}

# Log patterns
- "uploading file {filename}"
- "Databricks.*runId.*lifeCycleState"
- External URLs (vendor destinations)
```

### Example Tool Invocations

**User Query**: "What caused the NAT spike at 2am?"

**Claude Agent SDK Flow**:
1. Parses timestamp "2am" → today 02:00:00 UTC
2. Invokes tool: `check_nat_gateway_metrics(time_window_hours=3)`
   - Returns: "Spike detected at 02:15 - 12.5 GB in 5 minutes"
3. Invokes tool: `correlate_nat_spike_with_zeus_jobs(spike_timestamp="2025-10-16T02:15:00Z")`
   - Returns: "High confidence correlation with refresh-b5042937... for client Acrisure"
4. Synthesizes response: "The NAT spike at 2am was caused by an Acrisure refresh job uploading 12.5 GB to MEG via Databricks. This is expected for full client refreshes."

**User Follow-up**: "How long did the upload take?"

**Claude Agent SDK Flow** (with session context):
1. Remembers we're discussing refresh-b5042937...
2. Invokes tool: `find_zeus_jobs_during_timeframe()` with job-specific filter
3. Returns job start/end times
4. Synthesizes: "The upload took 3 hours (23:02 - 02:01 UTC)"

### Configuration Example
```yaml
# config/nat_gateway_config.yaml
nat_gateways:
  - nat_id: nat-07eb006676096fcd3
    name: dev-eks-nat-us-east-1c
    cluster: dev-eks
    vpc_id: vpc-00a81b349b5975c2e
    availability_zone: us-east-1c
    normal_baseline_gb: 5.0      # Typical 5-min traffic
    spike_threshold_gb: 10.0     # Alert threshold
    tags:
      Environment: dev
      Owner: devops@artemishealth.com

# Add other AZs when identified
  # - nat_id: nat-[id-for-1a]
  #   availability_zone: us-east-1a
  # - nat_id: nat-[id-for-1b]
  #   availability_zone: us-east-1b

zeus_job_search:
  namespaces:
    - devmatt
    - devzeus
    - devjason
  log_patterns:
    - "uploading file"
    - "sending.*request"
    - "lifeCycleState"
  log_tail_lines: 1000
  timeout_seconds: 5
```

## Validation Rules

1. **Time Window Validation**: `start_time < end_time`, maximum 7 days range (CloudWatch data retention)
2. **NAT Gateway Validation**: Must exist in config, must be associated with dev-eks VPC
3. **Namespace Validation**: Warn if namespace doesn't exist, don't fail query
4. **Timestamp Format**: Accept ISO 8601, Unix timestamp, or relative ("2 hours ago")
5. **Rate Limiting**: NAT queries count toward existing API rate limits (60/min authenticated)

## Error Handling

- **AWS CloudWatch throttling**: Retry once after 1 second, then return cached data or error message
- **Missing NAT gateway**: Return clear error: "NAT gateway {id} not found or not configured for this cluster"
- **K8s API timeout**: Return partial results: "Found X jobs, log analysis incomplete due to timeout"
- **No zeus jobs found**: Return informative message: "No zeus refresh jobs were running during the spike window. Traffic may be from other workloads."
- **LLM synthesis failure**: Return raw tool outputs: "Analysis unavailable, here's the raw data: {tool_outputs}"
- **Invalid timestamp**: Return validation error with example: "Invalid timestamp. Use ISO 8601 format: 2025-10-16T02:00:00Z"
