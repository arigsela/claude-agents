## Response Format Examples

### Healthy Service
```
‚úÖ Proteus Pods Status - HEALTHY

Overall: 5/5 pods running with zero restarts

Key Health Indicators:

## Troubleshooting Your Query

### If you get no response:

1. **Check workflow is active**: Look for green "Active" status in n8n
2. **Verify channel**: Make sure you're posting in "oncall-engineer" channel
3. **Check n8n logs**: Look for execution errors

### If response is generic (not using tools):

**Too vague**: ‚ùå `"Check stuff"`
**Better**: ‚úÖ `"Check proteus service in proteus-dev"`

**Too vague**: ‚ùå `"Is it up?"`
**Better**: ‚úÖ `"Is https://devops.artemishealth.com up?"`

### If you get an error message:

**"No text content in Teams message"**
‚Üí Send a text message (not just images/files)

**"Unable to query K8s cluster (timeout)"**
‚Üí oncall-agent API may be down or slow
‚Üí Try a simpler query or check oncall-agent service

**"Website check failed: Invalid URL"**
‚Üí Include full URL with https:// prefix

## Service Name Quick Reference

Use these exact service names for best results:

### Core Services
- `proteus` ‚Üí Main application backend
- `artemis-auth` ‚Üí Authentication/SSO
- `hermes` ‚Üí Messaging/notifications
- `zeus` ‚Üí Core service
- `plutus` ‚Üí Financial processing

### Namespaces
- `proteus-dev`
- `artemis-auth-dev` (or `artemis-auth-preprod`)
- `hermes-dev`
- `zeus-dev`
- `plutus-dev`

### Websites
- `https://devops.artemishealth.com`
- `https://api.artemishealth.com`
- `https://auth.artemishealth.com`
- `https://app.artemishealth.com`

---

## Tips for Best Results

### ‚úÖ Do:
- Be specific about service and namespace
- Include full URLs for website checks (https://)
- Ask follow-up questions in the same thread
- Use service names from the reference list

### ‚ùå Don't:
- Send image-only messages
- Use vague terms like "stuff" or "things"
- Expect the AI to remember context (each message is independent)
- Ask about production clusters (only dev-eks supported)

## Emergency Commands

### Critical Service Down
```
Check proteus service urgently - seeing 5xx errors
Full diagnostic on artemis-auth - login is broken
Emergency check on all critical services
```

### Performance Issues
```
Why is devops.artemishealth.com responding slowly?
Check for high CPU or memory in proteus pods
Are there any resource constraints in hermes-dev?
```

### After Deployment
```
Verify the proteus deployment that just completed
Check if the new hermes version is stable
Are there any issues after the recent deployment?
```

---

## Advanced Query Patterns

### Time-Based
```
Show me pod events from the last hour
What deployments happened in the last 30 minutes?
Check for restarts in the last 5 minutes
```

### Multi-Service
```
Compare health of proteus vs hermes
Check all services in artemis-auth-dev namespace
What's the overall cluster health?
```

### Correlation
```
Is the website down because of K8s issues?
Correlate devops.artemishealth.com status with backend health
Why did the site go down at 2pm?
```
