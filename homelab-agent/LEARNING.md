# LEARNING.md — LangGraph, explained through this agent

A concept glossary for a LangGraph newcomer, in the order the code was
built. Each section: what the concept is, why it exists, and exactly where
`homelab-agent` uses it.

Concepts covered as the build progresses:

1. State & reducers — `state.py`
2. StateGraph & nodes — `graph.py` (orient)
3. MCP tools as LangGraph tools & the A2A client — `tools.py`
4. `create_react_agent` vs a hand-built graph — `tools.py` (retrieve)
5. Conditional edges — `graph.py` (routing after retrieve)
6. Checkpointer & threads — `checkpointer.py`
7. The A2A serving contract — `server.py` / `executor.py`

(Sections are appended by the task that introduces each concept.)
